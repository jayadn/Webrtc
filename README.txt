WebRTC - short for Web Real-Time Communications - is a new standard that makes it possible to have a conversation from your Web browser.The WebRTC standard solves a very common problem: incompatibilities for real-time communications. Today, to place audio or video calls from a computer, users need to download proprietary software and create accounts. WebRTC leverages the recent trend in which the web browser is the “application”, and facilitates browser-to-browser communication, with no software downloads or registration needed. We intend to set up peer to peer video confrencing using Java Script and HTML5.

Moreover we intend to create a video using HTML5 and then upload it to Amazon S3.

The given project is a small part of a larger project under the New York Office of IIT Kanpur.
